🧪 XSS Labs

Hands-on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) labs designed to help security learners understand, practice, and analyze XSS vulnerabilities in a safe local environment.
The goal of this project is not just to provide payloads, but to teach the reasoning behind XSS:
Source → Data Flow → Context → Sink → Browser Interpretation → Impact → Mitigation 

🎯 Project Goals

This project focuses on understanding:

Reflected XSS

Stored XSS

DOM-based XSS

HTML Context

HTML Attribute Context

JavaScript Context

Event Handler Context

XSS filtering

Encoding

Dangerous DOM sinks

XSS mitigation

Each Lab introduces a specific concept and becomes progressively more challenging.

🚀 How to Use

Each Lab contains:
README.md ↓ Challenge ↓ Solve the Lab ↓ solution/README.md ↓ Walkthrough 

Recommended workflow

Read the Lab description.

Inspect the source code.

Follow the user-controlled input.

Identify the context.

Test your hypothesis.

Find a harmless proof of concept.

Understand the root cause.

Study the mitigation.

Try to solve each Lab before opening the solution.

🛡️ Ethics & Disclaimer

All Labs in this repository are intentionally vulnerable and are designed for educational purposes.
Run them locally or in an environment where you have explicit authorization to perform security testing.

⭐ Project Philosophy

Don't memorize payloads.
Understand the context.

XSS is not only about finding a working payload.
The real skill is understanding:
Where does the input come from? ↓ Where does it go? ↓ How is it transformed? ↓ What context does it enter? ↓ How does the browser interpret it? ↓ How can it be prevented?
